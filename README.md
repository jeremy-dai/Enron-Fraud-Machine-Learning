# Enron-Fraud-Machine-Learning

## Project Overview
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. 
By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. 
In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information 
entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data
for top executives. 

## Goal
Build a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data 
made public as a result of the Enron scandal. A hand-generated list of persons of interest in the fraud case is provided. 
These are the individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, 
or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.

## Steps
- clean the data.
- feature selection. SelectKBest function and PCA are used.
- choose the correct algorithm. GridSearchCV is used.
- evaluate the results
